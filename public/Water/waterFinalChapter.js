        <p>Under the glow of the full moon, the battle for the Northern Water Tribe has ended. 
        The Fire Nation's forces have been pushed back, and the tides of war have shifted in favor of balance and peace.</p>
        
        <p>As the ocean calms, you stand among your people, reflecting on the trials that brought you here. 
        The spirits of water have guided you through adversity, teaching you that true strength lies not only in power, 
        but in adaptability, unity, and wisdom.</p>
        
        <p>Now, the world turns to the Water Tribeâ€”not just as warriors, but as healers. 
        The time has come to rebuild, to mend what was broken, and to guide all nations toward a future of peace.</p>

        <p>Following Aang's arrival in the Southern Water Tribe, excitement and worry fill the air. Though Aang's presence is a blessing, it also brings danger. 
        A Fire Nation scouting ship is seen approaching the village. The elders debate the best course of actionâ€”should they hide Aang to protect him, prepare for battle, or try to avoid conflict altogether? 
        With Sokka eager to fight and Gran Gran urging caution, the fate of the village rests in your hands. What will you choose?</p>

        <p>After driving away the Fire Nation scouts, the village is left shaken but determined. Among the wreckage of a long-frozen ship buried in the ice, a discovery is madeâ€”a sealed chamber containing ancient waterbending artifacts and scrolls.
        The tribe's elders argue over what should be done. Some believe these relics belong to the past and should remain undisturbed, while others see an opportunity to reclaim lost knowledge. 
        With tensions rising and the memory of past Fire Nation raids still fresh, your choice could change the tribe's future.</p>

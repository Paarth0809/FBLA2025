        <p>Black snow begins to fall over the Northern Water Tribeâ€”a grim herald of approaching Fire Nation ships. 
        Admiral Zhao leads a massive invasion fleet, determined to capture the Avatar and destroy the Moon Spirit.
        As you stand on the ice walls beside Master Pakku and the other waterbenders, you feel both fear and 
        a newfound resolve. Your recent confrontation with your past has transformed you, but now an even greater 
        challenge looms. The tribe looks to both you and Aang for protection, and difficult choices lie ahead.</p>
